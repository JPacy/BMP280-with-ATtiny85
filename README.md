# BMP280-with-ATtiny85

This project interfaces an BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor with an ATtiny85 microcontroller. The communication between the sensor and ATtiny85 is done with SPI. 

## Programming

The ATtiny85 is programmed using an Arduino as ISP with the PlatformIO extension in VScode (avrdude).
